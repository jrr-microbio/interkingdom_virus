## Supplementary code for manuscript titled: Soil preparation methods affect DNA and RNA viral recovery as well as interpretation of viral ecology

The supplementary tables that area added here contain multiple sheets that are the direct inputs to the R markdown code. Within the Rmd there are specific isntances of which sheet from which table to use as input. Note that these had to be zipped into the files "SupplementalMaterials1_v2" and "SupplementalMaterials2_v2". Simply extract those into a dir and youre good. The rest should be (for the most part) automated to generate all figures and statistics that were used in the manuscript. The code should take around 10min to run once you set up all dependencies and software on a standard computer.

## Abstract: 
Deciphering viral ecology in soils is challenging due to soil’s high physiochemical and community complexity. To enhance detection of communities of DNA and RNA viruses, we applied different preparation methods to soils collected across a moisture gradient from a grassland field experiment. Analyses included metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of size-fractionated extracellular viruses and total soil, total soil metatranscriptomics with polyadenylation enrichment, and metagenomics of bacteria/archaea as well as eukaryote-enriched samples. DNA viromes outperformed total soil metagenomes. Contrastingly, while RNA viromes and total soil metatranscriptomes performed similarly for viral recovery, though RNA viromes identified higher-quality genomes. Further, we demonstrate the power of different preparation methods in identifying distinct viral communities with unique host predictions, which can have significant implications for ecological investigations related to interkingdom interactions. Finally, we show that relationships between vOTU diversity and expression by moisture vary for both DNA and RNA vOTUs and method, urging caution regarding ecological interpretation.
