## Supplementary code for manuscript titled: Comparisons of fractionation methods for DNA and RNA viruses unearths a multifaceted relationship between viruses and soil moisture

The supplementary tables that area added here contain multiple sheets that are the direct inputs to the R markdown code. Within the Rmd there are specific isntances of which sheet from which table to use as input. The rest should be (for the most part) automated to generate all figures and statistics that were used in the manuscript. The code should take around 10min to run once you set up all dependencies and software on a standard computer.

## Abstract: 
Deciphering viral ecology in soils is challenging due to their high physiochemical and community complexity. To enhance detection of sub-communities of DNA and RNA viruses, we applied fractionation approaches to soils collected across a moisture gradient from a grassland field experiment. Analyses included metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of size-fractionated extracellular viruses (i.e., DNA and RNA viromes), metagenomics of bacteria/archaea- or eukaryote-enriched samples, and whole soil metatranscriptomes with rRNA-depletion or polyadenylation enrichment. While RNA virome and whole soil RNA methods captured similar viral diversity, RNA viromes identified longer, higher-quality genomes. Further, we showed that significantly more DNA viruses were active in higher moisture than lower moisture samples, whereas responses by overall diversity vary by genome type (DNA versus RNA genomes). Finally, we demonstrate the power of fractionation approaches for identifying distinct viral communities that infect unique hosts, which has significant implications for ecological investigations, particularly related to interkingdom interactions.
